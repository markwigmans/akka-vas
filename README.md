========
This is a demonstrator of using Reactive (http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) / Lambda Architecture (http://lambda-architecture.net/) 
with a toy version of an Account System.

To use the application, perform the following steps:
- installation of maven/java-7 is already assumed
- install Redis (http://redis.io/)
- install mySQL (http://www.mysql.com/)
- update database settings in file 'src/main/resources/application.properties'
- run application via '_run.bat'

On a non Windows environment 'mvn spring-boot:run' can be used instead of '_run.bat'.
